This is a pizza website. Customers may buy pizza and other foods. Staff may mark orders as completed, which notifies customers.

#### Customer

Open "pizza_menu.php" to access the customer interface.

You can customize items, add items to a shopping cart, buy them at checkout, and see if your orders have been completed.

If you leave and come back to check on your order, you can log in with your phone number to see if your food is ready.

#### Staff

Open "chef_page.html" to access the staff interface.

Nothing will happen here until someone has ordered something through the customer interface.

The page lists all unfinished items customers have ordered and automatically updates as new orders arrive.

You can click the buttons to remove items, indicating that they are completed, and the customer will be informed.

#### Reset

If you want to reset the system for whatever reason, run "pizza_db_setup.php".
